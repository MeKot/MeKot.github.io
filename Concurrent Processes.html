<blockquote>
<em>Maybe better to skip lectures...</em>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
Basic coursework

<li>
Go programming

<li>
Material has not changed compared to last year

<li>
Last part on session types was optional, it is not anymore.

<li>
Go will not be in exams, but will be in coursework

<li>
Slides are text-rich

<li>
Books: (If individual project, then read the advanced book)
    • Introductory book:
        Communicating and Mobile Systems: the π-calculus (Milner 1999)
    • Advanced books:
        The π-calculus: a Theory of Mobile Processes (Sangiorgi, Walker 2001)

</ol>

<em>Pi-calculus</em>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
The π-calculus evolved from (value-passing) CCS, but it is more expressive

</ol>


<p>
```go
func main() {
</p>
<blockquote>
// Shared buffer with a size
a := main(chan int, 1)
b := make(chan bool, 1)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
go func () {
a &lt;- 1; // a with the bar on top (send the integer 1 to channel a)
} ()
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
i := &lt;- a // Input a
b &lt;- true // Output b
</blockquote>
<p>
}
```

<ul>
<li>
(ν a)(a⟨b⟩ | (ν c)c⟨a⟩) =α (ν d)(d⟨b⟩ | (ν c)c⟨d⟩ "=α" means that it is alpha-convertible

<li>
The intuition is that α-conversion preserves each difference between names.

<li>
Substitution:

<ul>
<li>
A substitution {a/x} applied to a process P (denoted by P{a/x}), has the effect of
        replacing all the free occurrences of x in P with a.

<li>
If the new name clashes with a bound variable, rename the bound variable (and he binding)

</ul>
<li>
Replication:

<ul>
<li>
!P ≡ P | !P

<li>
The way of expressing infinite computation

</ul>
<li>
Abstraction of a bound variable:

<ul>
<li>
a ̸∈ fn(P) =⇒ P | (ν a)Q ≡ (ν a)(P | Q)

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Tutorial 1"><h1 id="Tutorial 1" class="header"><a href="#Tutorial 1" class="justcenter">Tutorial 1</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
ν a creates a new channel a

<li>
a(x) passes a variable x to a channel a

<li>
You can output channels (since you know what they are before you output them)

<li>
You cannot receive channels, since you don't know that what you receive will be a channel

<li>
A "new"ed channel is bound everywhere within its scope (even if it is outputted)

<li>
You cannot rename free variables during substitution

<li>
Substitution does not have to preserve the original meaning of the exepression:

<ul>
<li>
In fact, it is the means of altering the expression

</ul>
<li>
The variable becomes bound in continuation process if it is received in the earlier
     parts of the process

</ul>
