<ol>
<li>
Consensus Algorithm that is easier to understand than Paxos

<li>
Leader Election:

<ul>
<li>
Every node can become a leader

<li>
Every node has an election timeout (randomised value within a set interval)

<li>
Once the election timeout occurs, the node becomes a candidate

<li>
Candidates send vote requests to all known nodes

<li>
Once the candidate receives the majority of votes, it becomes the Leader

<li>
The Leader sends heartbeat ("Append Log") messages to followers

<li>
If the replica has not received a heartbeat from the leader in its election timeout, it
      becomes a candidate, etc...

</ul>
<li>
Change Propagation:

<ul>
<li>
Client sends a change to the leader

<li>
The change is appended to the leaders log

<li>
The change is sent to the followers in the next heartbeat

<li>
An entry is "committed" once the majority of followers acknowledge it

<li>
Once the entry is committed, the response is sent to the client

</ul>
<li>
Resilience:

<ul>
<li>
In case of network partitions, raft separates into sub-clusters with their own leaders

<li>
A sub-cluster with the smaller number of nodes will be unable to commit transactions

<li>
When the network partition is healed:

<ul>
<li>
The leader with the lower follower count (<em>smaller</em>) will step down

<li>
The <em>smaller</em> and all its followers will rollback their logs to match the <em>bigger</em> one

<li>
This guarantees preservation of log consistency in the face of network failures

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
