<ol>
<li>
Testing a system using the inputs that are wholly or partially randomly-generated

<li>
<span id="Notes on Fuzzing-Goal"></span><strong id="Goal">Goal</strong>: Find inputs that make the SUT behave in interesting ways

<li>
Oracles:

<ul>
<li>
Determines if a test case passes or fails

<li>
Usually an oracle for correctness does not exist (beyond source-code assertions)

<li>
Derived oracles for correctness testing

</ul>
<li>
Generation-based fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
Inputs produced from nothing

</ul>
<li>
Mutation-based fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
Inputs produced from modification and/or combination of existing inputs

</ul>
<li>
Types of inputs the fuzzer may aim to produce:

<ul>
<li>
Totally invalid inputs (random strings)

<li>
Somewhat malformed inputs (sequences of tokens)

<li>
Inputs with a degree of validity (sentences in the grammar, but not well-typed)

<li>
High integrity inputs (well-formed inputs free from any undefined behaviour)

</ul>
<li>
Dumb Fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
Generates or mutates inputs without the knowledge of the SUT's input domain

<li>
Used in the original Fuzzing paper of 1990 that found UB in most of UNIX utilities

<li>
Could trigger stack overflow, division by 0, maybe an integer overflow

</ul>
<li>
Smart Fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
Uses some information about the expected input format

<li>
Has a high chance of getting stack underflows and signed integer overflows

<li>
Can be helped by <a href="Compiler sanitisers.html">Compiler sanitisers</a>

</ul>
<li>
Feedback-directed Fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
Can be smart or dumb

<li>
Input generation or mutation procedure is informed by observing the SUT on previous inputs

<li>
An input can be flagged if it makes the SUT do something noteworthy:

<ul>
<li>
Cover new code

<li>
Consume more memory than usual

<li>
Log a previously unseen message

<li>
Execute a particular syscall

</ul>
<li>
Having flagged input:

<ul>
<li>
Generation-based fuzzer tries to generate inputs with similar properties

<li>
Mutation-based fuzzer prioritises it over others when making a mutation

</ul>
<li>
Intuition:

<ul>
<li>
Input providing new coverage exercises the SUT in a new way

<li>
Related input may push the SUT further into the unknown

<li>
New message means either more coverage or has a noteworthy (for the SUT) property

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Black-box fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
SUT is exercised in an unmodified form

<li>
Advantages:

<ul>
<li>
Can be applied to closed source SUT's

<li>
SUT runs at full speed, enabling higher rate of fuzzing

</ul>
<li>
Disadvantages:

<ul>
<li>
Feedback-directed fuzzing can only make use of externally-visible behaviour

<li>
No coverage-directed fuzzing -&gt; May not cover all execution paths

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Grey-box fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
Instrumentation applied to the SUT, to expose information about its inner workings

<li>
Typically exposes coverage

<li>
Instrumentation can be applied at compile or binary level

<li>
Advantages:

<ul>
<li>
A feedback-directed fuzzer has more information to work with

</ul>
<li>
Disadvantages:

<ul>
<li>
Instrumentation overhead -&gt; Slower rate of fuzzing

<li>
Compile-time instrumentation requires access to the SUT sources

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
White-box fuzzing:

<ul>
<li>
Analysis via constraint solving used to generate inputs that exercise different parts of SUT

<li>
Can <em>prove</em> to cover all execution paths (given enough time)

<li>
Known as <a href="Symbolic and Concolic execution.html">Symbolic and Concolic execution</a>

<li>
In many ways this is not really fuzzing

<li>
Advantages:

<ul>
<li>
Constraint solvers generate inputs that reach hard to hit parts of the SUT

</ul>
<li>
Disadvantages:

<ul>
<li>
Slow (due to overhead of solving)

<li>
Heavyweight, requires specialised tool chain

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
AFL:

<ul>
<li>
Mutation-based, dumb, grey-box fuzzer

<li>
State of the art fuzzing for security

<li>
<span class="todo">TODO</span>: Read the paper on AFL

</ul>
<li>
Fuzzing compilers:

<ul>
<li>
What are the challenges:

<ul>
<li>
Absence of an oracle (for code generation)

<li>
Nondeterminism

<li>
Lack of clear language semantics

<li>
Undefined, unspecified and implementation-defined behaviour:

<ol>
<li>
Undefined - The standard imposes no requirement

<li>
Unspecified - The standard defines a set of allowable behaviours to choose at <span id="Notes on Fuzzing-any"></span><strong id="any">any</strong>
              occurrence

<li>
Implementation-defined - The standard defines a set of allowable behaviours;the
              compiler has to choose one and document a consistent behaviour

</ol>
</ul>
<li>
Compilers are non-testable because:

<ul>
<li>
There does not exist an oracle (for code generation)

<li>
It is theoretically possible, but practically too difficult to determine the correct output

</ul>
<li>
Ways to solve the absence of an oracle for code generation:

<ul>
<li>
Derived oracle -- not absolute source of truth

<li>
Cross-check implementations:

<ol>
<li>
Method:

<ol>
<li>
Compile the code with multiple different compilers and compare the output

<li>
Mismatches indicate bugs

<li>
Majority is probably correct

<li>
Known as differential testing

</ol>
<li>
Requirements:

<ol>
<li>
Program must be deterministic

<li>
Program must be free from undefined/unspecified behaviour

<li>
Multiple compilers must exist

<li>
Compilers must agree on implementation-defined behaviour

</ol>
</ol>
<li>
Cross-check equivalent programs:

<ol>
<li>
Method:

<ol>
<li>
Compile <em>equivalent</em> programs with one compiler

<li>
Mismatches indicate bugs

<li>
Majority is probably correct

<li>
Is a form of metamorphing testing

</ol>
<li>
Requirements:

<ol>
<li>
Equivalent programs (obviously)

<li>
Program must be deterministic

<li>
Program must be free from undefined/unspecified behaviour

</ol>
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Metamorphic testing:

<ul>
<li>
No reference implementation (oracle)

<li>
Exploit the property of an input when mutating it to obtain a result based on the result from
      the previous input (like <em>sin x</em> == <em>sin x + 2pi</em>)

<li>
Simply finding a function for input transformation that mutates output in a deterministic way

</ul>
<li>
Test case reduction:

<ul>
<li>
Transform the input in such a way that the property of interest is preserved

<li>
C-Reduce is a test case reducer for C programs

</ul>
</ol>
