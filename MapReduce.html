<ol>
<li>
Programming model and associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets

<li>
Map functions process a key/value pair and generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs

<li>
Reduce merges intermediate pairs into a final value for a key

<li>
Programs written in this way are automatically parallelised and run on large clusters

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Large amounts of data made it infeasible to run queries on a single machine.

<li>
Parallelisation, fault-tolerance, data distribution and load balancing --&gt; MapReduce

</ol>


<div id="Notes on MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters-Programming Model"><h2 id="Programming Model" class="header"><a href="#Notes on MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters-Programming Model" class="justcenter">Programming Model</a></h2></div>

<ol>
<li>
Computation is expressed in two functions (map and reduce, obvs)

<li>
Types:

<ul>
<li>
map (k1, v1) -&gt; list(k2, v2)

<li>
reduce (k2, list(v2)) -&gt; list(v2)

</ul>
</ol>


<div id="Notes on MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters-Implementation"><h2 id="Implementation" class="header"><a href="#Notes on MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters-Implementation" class="justcenter">Implementation</a></h2></div>

<ol>
<li>
Distributed Filesystem (GFS?) is used to manage the data stored on the disks of all machines in
   the MapReduce cluster. FS uses replication to mitigate limitations of commodity hardware.

<li>
Map invocations are distributed across multiple machines by partitioning input data into a set of
   splits

<li>
Splits can be processed in parallel on different machines

<li>
Reduce invocations are distributed by partitioning intermediate key space into R pieces:

<ul>
<li>
R is supplied by the user

<li>
Partitioning function ~~&gt; hash(key) mod R

</ul>
<li>
MapReduce steps:

<ol>
<li>
Client library partitions the data into M pieces (16-64 Mb each) and starts up many copies of
       the MapReduce on a cluster

<li>
One copy is started as a master and others are workers. Master assigns each idle worker with
       tasks from M and R

<li>
Workers with "Map" read their corresponding input split, parse it into key-value pairs and
       runs the user-defined map on all. Intermediate pairs are buffered in memory.

<li>
Periodically the buffered pairs are written to local disk, partitioned into R regions by the
       partitioning function. The locations for the partitions are passed to master

<li>
Master notifies the reduce workers of the locations of partitions. The reduce worker uses
       remote procedure calls to read the buffered data from the local disks. When all intermediate
       keys are read, reducer sorts them by key (to group same keys together)

<li>
Reducer iterates over the keys found and passes all corresponding intermediate values to the
       user-defined reduce function. The output of that function is appended to a final output file
       for this reduce partition

<li>
When all mappers and reducers terminate, the master wakes up the client by returning from a
       MapReduce call

</ol>
<li>
After successful execution, the output is available in the R output files, one per reducer

<li>
Fault Tolerance:

<ul>
<li>
Worker Failure:

<ul>
<li>
The master pings every worker periodically, marking workers that have been quiet for
          while as failed

<li>
Any map completed/running task of a failed worker is reset to its initial state and could
          be scheduled on other workers. Completed tasks are re-executed since their output is
          stored on the local disk of that machine and therefore is inaccessible on failure.
          Completed reduce tasks need not to be re-executed, as their output is stored on a global
          filesystem

<li>
When a map worker fails and another worker gets assigned to that tasks, all reducers are
          notified of that change

</ul>
<li>
Master Failure:

<ul>
<li>
When a master fails, the entire computation is aborted and the client is notified

</ul>
<li>
Semantics in the Presence of Failures:

<ul>
<li>
MapReduce produces the same results as sequential execution if both functions are
          deterministic functions of their respective inputs

<li>
Atomic commits of map and reduce help in achieving this property (saving temporary results
          on a filesystem)

<li>
Underlying filesystem must implement atomic rename (otherwise there may be conflicting
          reduce finishes that try to rename their temporary files into a final output file)

<li>
The semantics are weaker for the non-deterministic functions of map and/or reduce

</ul>
<li>
Locality:

<ul>
<li>
Conserving network bandwidth by sharding and replicating shards on three different
          machines

<li>
Master takes locations of raw files into account when scheduling the operations to
          minimise redistribution at runtime

</ul>
<li>
Task Granularity:

<ul>
<li>
Ideally M and R are much larger than the number of worker machines in the cluster. This
          would improve dynamic load balancing and speed up recovery when a worker fails

<li>
The bounds on M and R are in master, as it needs to make O(M+R) scheduling decisions and
          keeps O(M+R) states in memory

</ul>
<li>
Backup Tasks:

<ul>
<li>
"Stragglers" - machines that are taking a very long time to execute a step in map or
          reduce, slowing down the entire computation

<li>
When a MapReduce is close to completion the master schedules backup tasks for all
          <em>in-progress</em> tasks to be executed on other machines

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Refinements:

<ul>
<li>
Partitioning Function:

<ul>
<li>
Users specify the number of output partitions, data gets partitioned on intermediate keys
          with the (hash(key) mod R) function

<li>
It is possible to provide a custom partitioning function (i.e. hash(hostname(url) mod R)

</ul>
<li>
Ordering Guarantees:

<ul>
<li>
Guarantee that within a given partition, the intermediate key-value pairs are processed in
          the increasing key order

<li>
Perk of outputting data in a sorted format

</ul>
<li>
Combiner Function:

<ul>
<li>
Perform partial merging of the data before it is sent over the network to the reducer

<li>
Executed on each machine that performs a map task (typically the same as reduce)

</ul>
<li>
IO Types:

<ul>
<li>
Predefined input file formats or users can define their own <em>readers</em> to integrate with
          other services (such as databases, etc)

</ul>
<li>
Skipping Bad-Records:

<ul>
<li>
Bugs in user code cause map or reduce to deterministically crash on certain inputs

<li>
Detect and skip these records at runtime (if more than one failure occurs on a record)

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
