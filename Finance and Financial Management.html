<blockquote>
<em>Time value of money</em>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
Asset is a sequence of cashflows (essentially)

<li>
Future value is not the same as current value

<li>
The difference in future value and current value is called the yield

<li>
FV = PV(1 + R)<sup><small>T</small></sup>

<ul>
<li>
FV - Future Value

<li>
PV - Present Value

<li>
R  - Rate of change for a time period

<li>
T  - Number of time periods

</ul>
<li>
All cashflows can be converted to a common exchange point:

<ul>
<li>
How much is a £ in a year worth today?

<li>
How much is a £ today worth in a year?

</ul>
<li>
Discount Factor:

<ul>
<li>
How much £1 in the future is worth today

<li>
The higher the yield, the lower is the discount factor

</ul>
<li>
Discount Bond (Zero Coupon Bond):

<ul>
<li>
Issued in primary markets

<li>
Single payoff at the bond expiration date

</ul>
<li>
Complicated Asset:

<ul>
<li>
Multiple payoffs at time intervals in the future

<li>
PV and FV are the sums of all PVs and FVs in the future (adjusted for compound interest)

</ul>
