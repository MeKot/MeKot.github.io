<li>
Topics:
    • How the latest microprocessors work
    • Why they are built that way – and what are the alternatives?
    • How you can make software that uses the hardware in the best possible way
    • How you can make a compiler that does it for you
    • How you can design a computer for your problem
    • What does a big computer look like?
    • What are the fundamental big ideas and challenges in computer architecture?
    • What is the scope for theory?

<li>
Have a look at past papers:

<ul>
<li>
Some of the exam questions will be based on the article studied in class

<li>
In the exams - more of an essay ~&gt; Clear and informed thinking about the question at hand

<li>
20% coursework

</ul>

Turing award speech from Henessy and Paterson.

<li>
Opcode is always at the same position in the instruction

<li>
Source register is \\

<li>
Branch immediate is a memory offset from the current instruction

<li>
The “Turing Tax” is a term for the overhead (performance, cost, or energy) of universality
    in this sense

<li>
ASIC - Application-specific integrated circuit

Improving average memory access time:

<ul>
<li>
AMAT is a function of hits and misses (hit time + MissRate * MissPenalty)

</ul>
<li>
Types of cache misses:

<ul>
<li>
Compulsory - fresh data

<li>
Capacity - data was evicted because we loaded new data

<li>
Conflict - Cache is not full, but we still evicted a line because we inserted a line that
          had a conflicting index

<li>
Coherence - data invalidated by another processor or device

</ul>
<li>
Wave speculation (Textbook)

<li>
Victim Cache -- Search the main cache and the victim cache at the same time:

<ul>
<li>
A small cache for things that are being thrown away from the main cache

<li>
Check the victim cache in parallel with the cache

</ul>
<li>
Skewed-associative caches are computing hashes of tags and use the hashes as indices:

<ul>
<li>
Could be worse as the worst case scenario is more difficult to avoid

</ul>
<li>
Hardware Prefetching:

<ul>
<li>
As soon as we have a cache miss, we initiate a fetch for the next block

<li>
Similar to victim cache, since it has a side-cache, but the dataflow is reversed

<li>
Always check the stream buffer in parallel with the cache

<li>
Prefetch n+5 cache lines (enough to cover the access latency)

</ul>
</ol>
