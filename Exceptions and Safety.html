<blockquote>
<em>They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by</em>
<em>sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
There are four levels (hence the quote).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
No guarantee:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This means that anything can happen if the exception is thrown. Hence, the code with no
guarantee may leak resources, leave pointers dangling, or invalidate class invariants. Its a
wild west, essentially.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A good example is here:
</blockquote>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
        struct DoubleOwnership {
             std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt; pi;
             std::unique_ptr&lt;double&gt; pd;

             DoubleOwnership(int* pi_, double* pd_) : pi{pi_}, pd{pd_} {}
            };

            int foo() {
             DoubleOwnership object { new int(42), new double(3.14) };
             //...
        }
</pre>
<blockquote>
The problem with this is, that if an exception is thrown in the second <code>new</code>, then the function
execution stops and it is propagated out. However, memory allocated by the first <code>new</code> has not
yet been passed to the <code>unique_ptr</code> and therefore will not be freed!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Generally, any code that has not been proven to be exception safe should has no guarantee and
should be considered unsafe. Code without any exception guarantee is hard to work with â€“ we
cant know for sure the state of the objects after an exception is thrown, which means that we
possibly even cant properly clean up and destroy them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Basic guarantee:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In essence, it is a guarantee that if during the execution of the code an exception is thrown,
no resources are leaked and object invariants are not violated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
While this is better than no guarantee, is is still far from ideal. We have no idea about the
content and the state of the objects, but we know that we can use and destroy them (as
invariants are intact). That we can destroy them is probably the most important part of the
basic guarantee, since a thrown exception will incur some stack unwinding and affected objects
may get destroyed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Strong guarantee:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Adds to the basic guarantee that if an operation fails with an exception, then it leaves the
objects in the same state they were in before.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An example of a strong guarantee is the copy and swap idiom for assignment operators:
</blockquote>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
          Strong&amp; operator=(Strong const&amp; other) {
              Strong temp(other);
              temp.swap(*this);
              return *this;
          }
</pre>
<blockquote>
The steps are simple: first create a copy of the other object. This may throw an exception, but
if it does, the function is terminated early and nothing has happened to <code>*this</code> or the other
object yet. Then swap <code>*this</code> with the copy. For this to work, the swap operation may not throw
any exceptions. Examples are the exchange of a few pointers and other built in types. The swap
is the commit action, after that the assignment is complete. When the function is left with the
return statement, the temporary object is destroyed, cleaning up the state previously owned by
<code>*this</code>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Providing the strong guarantee can be costly. For example, imagine if the <code>Strong</code> object in
the example allocates large amounts of memory. Instead of reusing the already allocated memory,
the temporary has to allocate new memory just to release the old one after the swap.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<code>Nothrow</code> guarantee:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The operation <span id="CPP Exception safety-guarantees"></span><strong id="guarantees">guarantees</strong> not to throw any exception. Some examples of such operations would
be
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Destructors (they have to be <code>nothrow</code>, as thy are called during stack unwinding)

<li>
Any cleanup operations like closing files and releasing memory and anything else called from
      the destructor has to be <code>nothrow</code>

<li>
Swap operations (expected to be <code>nothrow</code>)

</ul>
