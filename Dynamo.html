<blockquote>
<em>By Amazon</em>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
Background:

<ul>
<li>
Simple key-value interface

<li>
Highly available with a clearly-defined consistency window

<li>
State is stored as binary objects (blobs) identified by unique keys

<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-No operations span multiple data items and there is no relational schema"></span><strong id="No operations span multiple data items and there is no relational schema">No operations span multiple data items and there is no relational schema</strong>

<li>
Dynamo targets applications that need to store relatively small objects (less than 1 MB)

<li>
They dropped the C from ACID (for higher availability)

<li>
Scalability is limited

<li>
Dynamo is assumed to be operating in "safe space" and therefore it lacks security extensions

<li>
As everything else at Amazon, Dynamo is "eventually consistent"

<li>
Conflict resolution happens on reads --&gt; "Always writable" service

</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Architecture details:

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Interface:

<ul>
<li>
Exposes two operations <em>get</em> and <em>put</em>:

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-GET(key)"></span><strong id="GET(key)">GET(key)</strong> locates the object replicas associated with the key in the storage system and
              returns a single object (or a list of objects with conflicting versions) that are
              stored under that key along with a <em>context</em>

<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-PUT(key, context, object)"></span><strong id="PUT(key, context, object)">PUT(key, context, object)</strong> operation determines where the replicas of the object
              should be placed depending on the key and writes replicas to disk (async)

<li>
<em>context</em> encodes system metadata about the object that is opaque to the caller and
              includes informations such as the version of the object. This information is stored
              along with the object in order to verify context validity during <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-PUT"></span><strong id="PUT">PUT</strong>

</ul>
<li>
Key and object are both treated as an opaque array of bytes (so... A string?)

<li>
Key is MD5-hashed to generate an 128 bit identifier

</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Partitioning:

<ul>
<li>
Output space of a hash function is treated as a "ring"

<li>
Hash the key and walk the ring to find the node that is responsible for a bigger hash.
          Store the object under its hashed key in that node

<li>
To avoid heterogeneity problems, each node has multiple values on the ring (Virtual nodes)

<li>
Whenever a new node is added, it is assigned to multiple positions ("tokens") on the ring

<li>
<code>ADVANTAGES:</code> <em>of virtual nodes</em>

<ul>
<li>
If a node becomes unavailable, the load handled by it is evenly dispersed among other
              available nodes

<li>
Whenever a new node becomes available, it receives roughly a similar amount of load
              from existing nodes

<li>
The number of virtual nodes ("tokens") for any given node could be adjusted based on
              its physical capabilities, allowing for hardware heterogeneity

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Replication:

<ul>
<li>
Data is replicated on multiple hosts

<li>
Each node is in charge of replication and the number of replicas for different keys can
          vary, as it is configured on the "per-instance" basis

<li>
The key (and the object gets replicated at the N-1 successive nodes on the ring

<li>
The list of nodes that are responsible for storing a particular key is called the
          "preference list"

<li>
Preference list is constructed to ensure that there are only distinct nodes in it

</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Versioning:

<ul>
<li>
When the object is updated by the client, but the latest version is not available, the
          changes are applied to the older version and later on both version are reconciled

<li>
As an example, items added to cart are never lost, but deleted items can resurface

<li>
Vector clocks are used to capture causality between different versions of the data:

<ul>
<li>
A vector clock is effectively a list of (node, counter) pairs

<li>
One vector clock is associated with every version of every object

<li>
If the counters on the first objects clock are &lt;= to all the nodes in the second clock
              then the first node is an ancestor of the second and can be forgotten

<li>
Otherwise the two changes are conflicting and need to be merged

</ul>
<li>
Whenever an object is updated, the client must specify which version it is updating (via
          the <em>context</em> included in both - return of <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-GET"></span><strong id="GET">GET</strong> and parameter for <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-PUT"></span><strong id="PUT">PUT</strong>)

<li>
The <em>context</em> contains the vector clock information

<li>
When processing the <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-GET"></span><strong id="GET">GET</strong> request, if there are multiple objects that cannot be
          syntactically reconciled, Dynamo will return a list of them, with corresponding version
          information for all of them

<li>
An update using this <em>context</em> is considered to be reconciling all conflicts

<li>
<span class="todo">TODO</span>: Describe vector clock transformations that happen on conflicts and how they are
          resolved

</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Depths of <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-GET"></span><strong id="GET">GET</strong> and <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-PUT"></span><strong id="PUT">PUT</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Any storage node in Dynamo is eligible to receive requests from clients for any key

<li>
Node selection by client:

<ol>
<li>
Call via a loadbalancer, which will forward it based on the load

<li>
Call via partition-aware client library that routes requests directly to the handling
               node

</ol>
<li>
The approaches mostly differ by the amount of coupling with Dynamo (and latency)

<li>
Read and write operations involve the first N healthy nodes in the preference list,
          skipping over those that are down or inaccessible

<li>
To maintain consistency, a quorum protocol is used:

<ul>
<li>
R - min number of nodes for a successful read

<li>
W - min number of nodes for a successful write

<li>
R + W &gt; N

<li>
The latency of a read/write is dictated by the slowest replica in R/W

<li>
Hence, each R and W are usually less than N for latency

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-PUT:"></span><strong id="PUT:">PUT:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Coordinator generates the vector clock and stores the updated version locally

<li>
Coordinator sends the new version along with the new vector clock to the N
              highest-ranked nodes

<li>
If at least W-1 nodes respond -&gt; write is successful

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-GET:"></span><strong id="GET:">GET:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Coordinator requests all existing versions of data for that key from the N
              highest-ranked nodes

<li>
Coordinator waits for R responses before returning the result to the client

<li>
If there are conflicting versions, a vector of all versions is returned (with
              <em>context</em> for each)

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Failure handling:

<ul>
<li>
"Sloppy quorum" -- all reads and writes are performed on the first N healthy nodes in the
          preference list

<li>
<span class="todo">TODO</span>: Work through an example on Figure 2, where A has failed

<li>
Whenever a node receives the update that should have been handled by another node, it also
          receives a "hint" in its metadata

<li>
A hint suggests which node was the intended recipient of the replica

<li>
Nodes have a separate local database for "hinted" replicas

<li>
If a node detects that some intended recipient has recovered, it will forward the replica
          to the recovered node and on success will delete it from the local "hinted" store

<li>
Hinted Handoff ensures that no read/write operation fails because the intended coordinator
          is down, or because there are some network issues

<li>
If W==1, writes will be accepted, if at least 1 node is healthy <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-extreme availability"></span><strong id="extreme availability">extreme availability</strong>

</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Handling permanent failures:

<ul>
<li>
The case where a replica becomes unavailable before it can return the hinted handoff

<li>
Anti-entropy (replica sync) protocol:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="Merkle trees.html">Merkle trees</a> reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred, allow
              parallel search through branches

<li>
E.g: if the hash values of the root are of two trees are equal then the values of the
              leaf nodes in the trees are equal as well and the nodes require no synchronisation

<li>
If the root hashes are different --&gt; some of the replicas are different

<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store------------------------------------THE PROTOCOL--------------------------------------"></span><strong id="-----------------------------------THE PROTOCOL--------------------------------------">-----------------------------------THE PROTOCOL--------------------------------------</strong>

<li>
Each node maintains a separate Merkle tree for each key range (set of keys covered by
              one of its virtual nodes)

<li>
Two nodes exchange the root of the Merkle tree corresponding to the key ranges they
              share

<li>
They then traverse the trees to determine exactly which replicas are out of sync

<li>
One disadvantage is that when a new node joins, the ranges change and all trees need
              to be recalculated

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Membership and failure detection:

<ul>
<li>
A node outage should not immediately be interpreted as a permanent departure and trigger
          the partition assignment rebalancing

<li>
There is no automatic membership change --&gt; <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-Requires human intervention"></span><strong id="Requires human intervention">Requires human intervention</strong>

<li>
The node that serves the membership change writes it to its local history

<li>
The change is propagated to all nodes with a gossip-based protocol

<li>
The view of membership is eventually consistent

<li>
Each node contacts a peer chosen at random every second and the two nodes reconcile their
          persistent membership change histories

<li>
The mappings also contain the partitions of the hash space that the node is covering
          allowing for faster request routing between nodes (direct route)

<li>
Avoiding logical partitions:

<ul>
<li>
Some nodes play the role of <em>seeds</em>

<li>
<em>Seeds</em> are nodes that are discovered via an external mechanism and are known to all
              nodes in a Dynamo ring

<li>
Eventually all nodes will reconcile with a seed, thus avoiding logical partitions

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-Failure detection:"></span><strong id="Failure detection:">Failure detection:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Main purpose is to avoid communication with dead nodes during <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-GET"></span><strong id="GET">GET</strong> and <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-PUT"></span><strong id="PUT">PUT</strong>

<li>
Local notion of failure is sufficient -&gt; Node B is considered failed by node A if B
              does not respond to A's messages

<li>
Nodes will periodically retry communication with the "failed" nodes

<li>
Failure discovery is driven by clients requests and in the absence of those won't
              happen

<li>
<span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-No node is automatically marked as departed"></span><strong id="No node is automatically marked as departed">No node is automatically marked as departed</strong> --&gt; <em>requires human intervention</em>

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Adding/Removing Storage Nodes:

<ul>
<li>
When X is added to the system it gets assigned a number of tokens, that are scattered on
          the ring

<li>
<span class="todo">TODO</span>: Describe a simple scenario where we add a node to the ring on Figure 2 between A &amp; B

<li>
<span class="todo">TODO</span>: <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-If failed"></span><strong id="If failed">If failed</strong> do the removal of a node

</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Implementation:

<ul>
<li>
Storage nodes have 3 components:

<ol>
<li>
Request Coordination:

<ol>
<li>
Event-driven messaging substrate (staged message processing pipeline, like in SEDA)

<li>
Communications are implemented with Java non-blocking IO channels

<li>
The node receiving a request creates a state machine, it contains:

<ul>
<li>
Logic for identifying the nodes responsible for a key

<li>
Requesting, awaiting responses and potentially retrying

<li>
Processing replies and packaging the response to the client

</ul>
<li>
There is a state machine <em>per each individual request</em>

<li>
<span class="todo">TODO</span>: Outline the read request state machine

<li>
After the read request completes the state machine waits for a while for "late"
              responses. If any of the responses are stale, the coordinator will update
              corresponding nodes. This process is called <span id="Notes on Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store-read repair"></span><strong id="read repair">read repair</strong>

<li>
Coordinator for the write is chosen to be the node that replied fastest to the
              preceding read operation (on the probabilistic expectation that R and W are connected)

</ol>
<li>
Membership

<li>
Failure detection

</ol>
<li>
Storage implementation is interfaced and allows for different engines to be plugged in. These
      differ by the size of objects they store and the storage models (in-memory buffers, etc)

</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Lessons Learned:

<ul>
<li>
General:

<ul>
<li>
Business logic specific reconciliation:

<ol>
<li>
The shopping cart example -&gt; added items are never lost, but we can tolerate
              resurfacing of the deleted items.

</ol>
<li>
Timestamp based reconciliation:

<ol>
<li>
Last write wins policy

<li>
Useful for the client session management

</ol>
<li>
High performance read engine:

<ol>
<li>
Easy to balance what the service is tailored for by adjusting R and W accordingly

</ol>
</ul>
<li>
Balancing Performance and durability:

<ul>
<li>
Keeping an in-memory write buffer helped to bridge that gap

</ul>
<li>
Ensuring Uniform Load distribution:

<ul>
<li>
Uniform key (hash) distribution ensures that the load is uniformly distributed across the
          ring which ensures that the load is balanced across nodes

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
