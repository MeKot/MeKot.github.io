<p>
Every company that develops a custom solution needs to settle on a particular architecture, whether
it will be a collection of fine-grained microservices, a monolithic application or something in
between. In recent years microservices have been at the forefront of most books, articles and
company initiatives [12]. This prompted numerous businesses to adopt the architecture early on
without considering if it would work for their product and within the company structure.
Nonetheless, there are also numerous examples where adopting microservices increased the rate of
iteration and was a good fit for the organisational structure. Monzo are famous for their successful
use of 1600 microservices in production. For a medium-sized company with about 250 engineers, this
is all the more impressive. This raises the question of why they are so successful and why other
companies such as Segment have failed to migrate their architecture to microservices?
</p>

<div id="The Monzo way"><h2 id="The Monzo way" class="header"><a href="#The Monzo way" class="justcenter">The Monzo way</a></h2></div>

<p>
Monzo from the ground up were oriented at delivering a fault-tolerant, real-time service to their
customers and therefore, were building their platform with that in mind. From past examples provided
by Amazon, Netflix and Twitter they knew that a large monolithic application does not scale well to
a large number of users and developers [6]. Therefore, a system formed of many small single-purpose
services appeared to be an optimal solution.
</p>

<p>
There are several factors contributing to Monzo's overwhelming success in managing a large fleet of
microservices. A key principle is that each one of the services is small and context bound. This
creates additional flexibility when scaling or introducing changes, as well as allowing each
individual service to be fully self-contained. Changes to self-contained services are quicker to
deploy than similar changes in the context of a monolithic system, since they do need to be
recompiled and relinked.  Furthermore, self-contained services are language agnostic, allowing
different teams to focus on the business problem and use the best tools for the job. An example of
that would be platform teams using Go, while data analytics teams would use Python, as each one of
those languages allows them to use highly-specialised and extremely performant libraries for their
tasks. Another key principle is statelessness and fault tolerance. The two are linked together
through the operational strategy. At Monzo each service is expected to fail an be redeployed at any
point and, hence, connected services are built with that in mind. Statelessness therefore is crucial
in the service design, as any previous state would be lost on redeployment. Another architectural
decision that appears to have worked well for Monzo is queuing specific jobs and completing them in
the background. This has decreased the amount of work on the hot path of the request as well as
created a clear way of adding new non-essential features as a separate service.  There are a few
strategies employed concerning queue resilience and delivery policy that allow Monzo to separate
specific tasks from the workload and send them to be processed in a separate service. Finally, Monzo
are using gossip protocols for communication between services for propagation of non-essential
information. This created additional channels for communication between services and makes
maintenance tasks such as configuration propagation easier.

There are however, some cases where microservices proved to be less advantageous. Segment is a Bay
Area startup that exposes a unified API for customer-data aggregation and analysis. The API fronts a
variety of services, such as Google Analytics, Optimisely, etc [13]. Their product therefore is a
data analysis platform, whereby users would be able to select a number of external data analysis
systems and aggregate all of their results on a single platform. The unique selling point is that
all of the data is sent to a single API and is consumed from a single API, thus integration
complexity and data transformations are abstracted away form the customer [14]. Their approach with
microservices was creating a single "handler" service for each external analysis system. Observed
advantages of such an approach were increased speed of iteration for each "handler", as code was no
longer coupled with the rest of the system and decreased pressure on the system as different
requests were now handled by different services. Segment grew and connected with additional
platforms, which required new handlers. Eventually, a lot of common functionality was extracted into
shared libraries, which made addition of new platforms extremely easy. However, these new
abstractions came at a cost of managing them. Over time versions of shared libraries used by each
"handler" diverged from one another which made addition of new changes to them am unnecessarily
complex task [4].

<div id="Why have they failed"><h2 id="Why have they failed" class="header"><a href="#Why have they failed" class="justcenter">Why have they failed</a></h2></div>

<p>
In order to determine why Segment and others were unsuccessful in introducing microservices to their
architecture, we could analyse some of the specific details about the company as well as the
decisions made along the way.
</p>

<p>
Segment is a relatively small company that to this day has less than 100 engineers.  Introducing a
large number of disjoint services each of which needed to be maintained and "owned" by a certain
team has triggered the Inverse Conway's Law whereby developers like services themselves became
over-specialised and lost perspective of the entire system [9]. Furthermore, additional complexities
were introduced for each team as now that had to manage their own deployments, which sometimes
depended on other teams work.  This leads us to the issue of "dealing with code reuse in a 'share
nothing' architecture" [2] is considered to be an anti-pattern [5] as it introduces a "dependency
hell" where each service depends on multiple custom shared libraries. Hence, the observed issue of
decreasing overall reliability rooted in weakened change control [5] and complicated deployments as
they were now burdened by shared library version management.
</p>

<p>
Another very important issue that Segment ran into was accumulating debt by focusing on feature
delivery. For a startup, feature delivery is of the utmost importance, as their funding is directly
related to it.  Microservices are particularly suited for this, as they allow to develop several
features concurrently and have very quick iteration and release cycles [7]. However, at very high
rates of iteration, technical debt is accumulated to "just get it done now, and worry about that
later" [8].  Accumulating large amounts of technical debt, such as not solving the load-balancing
and scaling problem [4] caused further issues and outages to the point where engineers had to
manually scale some of the services [4].
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, additional complexity was added by splitting the codebase into multiple repositories
[4].  Such a decision made developers unaware of where some of the code was located, as well as
further complicated dependency resolution, as dependant services had to be updated in a cascading
manner [14].
</p>

<p>
Finally, one of the biggest reasons why Segment failed to adopt microservices was their reluctance
to embrace the organisational change in development cycle required for microservices [7]. Their test
suite was still focused on the overall functionality and was testing live endpoints [4]. Hence,
running the tests was an expensive and time-consuming operation that slowed down their rate of
iteration, practically negating all the benefits they have received from adopting microservices in
the first place.
</p>

<p>
Overall, Segment has failed to adopt microservices due to the immaturity of the company and the
platform [11], lack of a comprehensive test suite that would catch issues early and a rash decision
to move to a multi-repo structure [15].
</p>

<p>
Monzo were "pragmatic" from the conception building services to be self-contained and aggressively
binding a service to a specific context [16]. The decision to allocate a service proactively,
instead of sharing some functionality in a library saved Monzo from the "dependency hell"
encountered by Segment. Furthermore, to reduce the cost of having so many services, Monzo developed
their own RPC witch custom load balancing and routing, automatic retries and connection pooling
[18]. This allowed them to minimise the impact on the latency of user requests, while also
simplifying creation and integration of a new service. In addition, Monzo structured all of their
code in a monorepo, which allowed every engineer to have access and be aware of the entire platform
[1]. A particular attention was given to monitoring whereby each individual service is reporting
standard metrics such as CPU and memory usage as well as custom metrics for custom alerts, such as a
sudden influx of customers [17]. Another area of problems Monzo avoided was blocking on calls to
connecting services by making "much of the work on the backend asynchronous" [18].  Finally, Monzo
as an organisation was built around microservices and encouraged active communication between
different teams and departments to the point where an on-call would have to fix issues outside of
his domain [1]. This created a collaborative engineering culture where teams did not "lock-in" to
their domain, but rather were capable of working on virtually any part of the system. To simplify
this tremendous tasks for the engineers, Monzo developed and enforced strict rules on how a service
is to be defined, connected and internally engineered.

<p>
Microservices as an architecture appears to be extremely powerful and provides such benefits as
clear separation of concerns, independent and parallel development on several components at once and
loose coupling of the subsystems. However, as shown by the Segment, microservices are not a
universal solution and are hard to implement correctly. Segment as a company had a number of issues
with the original architecture that they hoped to fix by moving to microservices [14]. Even though
they did achieve some of the goals by this move [19], it only covered up the underlying issues with
lack of proper internal testing, underdeveloped organisational structure and platform design that
was not performant enough. After moving back to monolith, Segment ended up reimplementing most of
its platform to better address both performance and scalability [19]. Monzo on the other hand
targeted microservices from the ground-up with its organisational structure. Clear goals and
expectations for every subsystem as well as strong internal tooling allowed them to control
technical debt and separation of concerns well. This led to a coherent platform design that Monzo
actively enforces on all its internal services. Microservices are a more
scalable software engineering technique compared to monolith [8] and many applications can benefit
from moving to them [5]. However, the transition is complicated and will likely require
re-engineering not just internal tooling, but the company structure itself [9].
