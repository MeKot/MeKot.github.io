<li>
Large distributed systems are vulnerable to many types of failures, not just
   the standard network partitions and fail-stop failures. E.g. memory and
   network corruption, large clock skew, hung machines, extended and asymmetric
   network partitions, bugs in other systems, GFS quotas, planned and unplanned
   hardware maintenance.

<li>
Another lesson we learned is that it is important to delay adding new
   features until it is clear how the new features will be used. For example,
   we initially planned to support general-purpose transactions in our API.
   Because we did not have an immediate use for them, however, we did not
   implement them.

<li>
The most important lesson we learned is the value of simple designs. Given
   both the size of our system (about 100,000 lines of non-test code), as well
   as the fact that code evolves over time in unexpected ways, we have found
   that code and design clarity are of immense help in code maintenance and
   debugging.
