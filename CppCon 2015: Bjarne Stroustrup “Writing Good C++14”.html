Initial work on making CPP better:

<ul>
<li>
Core guidelines for CPP

<li>
Guidelines support library

<li>
Analysis tool by Microsoft (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/code-analysis-for-c-cpp-overview?view=vs-2019)">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/code-analysis-for-c-cpp-overview?view=vs-2019)</a>

</ul>
<li>
Additional talks:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="CppCon 2015: Herb Sutter &quot;Writing Good C++14... By Default&quot;.html">CppCon 2015: Herb Sutter "Writing Good C++14... By Default"</a>

<li>
Some more (maybe later)

</ul>
<li>
A set of guidelines to write CPP with:

<ol>
<li>
High-level rules:

<ul>
<li>
Express ideas directly in code (compilers don't write comments)

<li>
Write ISO Standard C++ (<a href="https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard)">https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard)</a>

<li>
Express intent

<li>
Ideally a program should be statically type-safe

<li>
Prefer compile-time checking to runtime checking

<li>
What cannot be checked at compile time should be checked at runtime

<li>
Catch runtime errors as early as possible

<li>
Don't leak any resources

<li>
Don't waste time or space

</ul>
<li>
Low-level rules:

<ul>
<li>
Used primarily in tooling

<li>
Derived from standards

<li>
Help to unify style

<li>
Not minimal or orthogonal

</ul>
<li>
Guidelines Support Library

</ol>
<li>
Solving dangling pointers:

<ul>
<li>
Distinguish between owners and non-owners

<li>
Assume raw pointers to be non-owners

<li>
Every object has an owner (<a href="RAII.html">RAII</a>), use smart pointers

<li>
Use GSL owner&lt;T&gt; construct (which is just an alias for T*) <span id="Writing good C++14-only for naked pointers!!!"></span><strong id="only for naked pointers!!!">only for naked pointers!!!</strong>

</ul>
<li>
The owners need to disappear into abstractions

</ol>
