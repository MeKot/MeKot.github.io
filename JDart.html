<ol>
<li>
Consists of the explorer and the executor 

<ol>
<li>
The explorer determines the exploration strategy (order of traversal) 

<ol>
<li>
Organises recorded (by executor) path into a constraints tree

<li>
Decides which paths to explore next and when to stop exploration

<li>
Currently uses JConstraints (layer of abstraction for symbolic paths constraints and 
         an interface to the existing constraint solvers)

<li>
 Solvers supported: 

<ol>
<li>
Coral -- supports trigonometric constraints

<li>
SMTInterpol

<li>
Z3    -- Trig is approximated, floats are approximated by reals

Note on exploration:
In order to hit interesting paths quicker when analysing large systems, JDart needs to be

<ol>
<li>
The executor executes (obviously) the analysed program and records symbolic constraints 

</ol>
<blockquote>
For execution the JPF engine is used that suppotrts native peers, symbolic objects and 
Concolic Bytecode Semantics. Using it has several benefits such as ease of JDart extension 
by integration of existing JPF plugins/extenstions. JPF provides easy access to all objects 
on the heap and stack ans well as to other elements of the JVM (stack frames and classloaders)
However, using a full-blown custon JVM (which JPF is) has significant impact on performance..
Thats why the JPF integration in JDart is very loose (possibly swapped to a more light-weight
implementation in the future)

<ol>
<li>
Provides a few useful plugins, such as: 

<ol>
<li>
Method summarisation

<li>
JUnit test case generation (leverages the results of dynamic symbolic analysis)

</ol>
<li>
<span id="Notes-Can be used as a symbolic execution component within other tools"></span><strong id="Can be used as a symbolic execution component within other tools">Can be used as a symbolic execution component within other tools</strong> 

<ol>
<li>
PSYCHO   -- tool that uses automata learning and dyn symb exec to automatically 
      generate extended interfaces for java library components

<li>
JPF-Doop -- tool that combines random feedback-directed generation of method sequences 
      with dynamic symbolic execution for automatic testing of java libraries

</ol>
<li>
Has been proven to work and thoroughly tested by NASA (they have used it to generate 
   tests for the air traffic control system - so it practically is proven to be correct)

<li>
By default, JDart treats only parameters symbolically 

<ol>
<li>
<span id="Notes-But this could be extended to instance fields and return values as well"></span><strong id="But this could be extended to instance fields and return values as well">But this could be extended to instance fields and return values as well</strong>

</ol>
<li>
JDart is designed to allow for easy replacement of all of its components, supports different 
   and combined constraint solvers and several exploration strategies and termination criteria

<li>
JDart provides an interface for implementing customised termination strategies (time vs paths)

<li>
Progress in only made when evaluating semantics in solvers 

</ol>

<blockquote>
<em>The devil is not as black as he is painted</em> 
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
Executes programs with concrete and symbolic inputs at the same time

<li>
Maintains a path constraint (conjunction of symbolic expressions over the inputs that is 
   updated whenever a branch instruction is executed)

<li>
Combined execution paths for a constraints tree, which is continuously expanded

<li>
Concrete data values for excercising these paths are generated by a constraint solver 

</ol>


<div id="Notes-JDart Architecture"><h2 id="JDart Architecture" class="header"><a href="#Notes-JDart Architecture" class="justcenter">JDart Architecture</a></h2></div>
<ol>
<li>
Executes java bytecode and performs dynamic symbolic analysis of <span id="Notes-JDart Architecture-specific paths"></span><strong id="specific paths">specific paths</strong> <em>???</em>

<li>
Implements extensions that build upon the analysis 

<ol>
<li>
The Method Summariser -- generates flly abstract method summaries for analysied methods. 
      In the generated summaries, class members, input parameters and return values are symbolic.

<li>
The Tests Suite Generator -- generates a JUnit test suit that excercises all the paths found

</ol>
</ol>

<div id="Notes-JDart vs SPF"><h2 id="JDart vs SPF" class="header"><a href="#Notes-JDart vs SPF" class="justcenter">JDart vs SPF</a></h2></div>
<ol>
<li>
SPF can work with concolic execution (switch to concrete values - concolic)

<li>
Parallelising SPF has been done

<li>
Method summarisation for SPF

<li>
JDart does not support programs with concurrency... SPF does

<li>
SPF - lazy initialisation (to deal with unbounded symbolic input data)

<li>
SPF crashes with Z3, leaving CORAL as the only viable solver, which means that it ignores some 
   constraints

<li>
JDart generates stronger test suites   

<li>
More stable and way more consistent...
