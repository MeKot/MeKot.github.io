<em>Initial Writeup</em>
</blockquote>



<ol>
<li>
There are a total of 52 cards in play

<li>
Every Market Maker is given 5 cards

<li>
The speculator only has 3 cards (Stronger in the endgame?)

<li>
The remaining 29 cards are revealed one at a time after which the players can bid on a suit

<li>
The suit at the bottom pays out contracts:

<ul>
<li>
All contracts are worth £1

<li>
Contracts that didn't pay out (other suits) are worth £0

</ul>
<li>
Win condition? (Get the most money...)

<li>
The game seems more behavioural

</ol>

<p>
For each suit, at any given point in time the probability of it being at the bottom is
(13 - revealed - hidden_in_hand) / (52 - revealed)
</p>
