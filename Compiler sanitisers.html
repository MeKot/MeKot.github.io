<em>Primarily GCC and maybe Clang</em>

<ol>
<li>
Compiler-based dynamic analysis at compile time that can reliably detect errors

<li>
Address Sanitiser:

<ul>
<li>
ASan, <code>-fsanitise=address</code>

<li>
To get reasonable performance, one can use <code>-O1</code>

<li>
To get nicer stack trace in error messages use <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code>

<li>
Detects out-of-bounds accesses, use-after-free errors, memory leaks, etc..

<li>
Can detect stack buffer overflow

<li>
Accesses in uninstrumented code are not checked (while allocations and accesses after are)

<li>
Instrumentation is a compiler module that performs an LLVM pass

<li>
Before each memory access (*addr), add an <code>if_poisoned</code> check that throws an error

<li>
Memory mapping and instrumentation:

<ul>
<li>
Virtual memory is divided in two disjoint classes (Mem and Shadow)

<li>
Shadow contains metadata about the actual memory used by the application (Mem)

<li>
Poisoning a byte in application memory means writing a special byte into the Shadow
          partition

<li>
Both classes are laid out in a way which makes conversion Shadow&lt;-&gt;Mem fast

<li>
ASan maps 8 bytes of the application memory to 1 byte of the Shadow memory

</ul>
<li>
Shadow memory:

<ul>
<li>
All bytes are addresible: shadow_byte = 0

<li>
No bytes are addresible: shadow_byte &lt; 0

<li>
First k bytes are addresible: shadow_byte = k

</ul>
<li>
In order to catch stack buffer overflow:

<ul>
<li>
Allocate a 32 byte poisoned buffer before an array on the stack

<li>
Allocate a 32 byte poisoned buffer after the array on the stack

<li>
Buffer the array on the stack to be a multiple of 32 bytes

<li>
In its current compact mapping implementation, cannot catch partially unaligned OOB
          accesses. A viable solution is described here
          (<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/100),">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/100),</a> but it comes at a performance cost

</ul>
<li>
The runtime library replaces malloc/free and provides reporting functions like
      <code>_asan_report_load8</code>

<li>
New malloc allocates a block of memory with red-zones around it

<li>
Free poisons shadow values for the entire region and puts the chunk of memory into a
      quarantine queue

<li>

<li>
False positives:

<ul>
<li>
None by design

</ul>
<li>
False Negatives:

<ul>
<li>
Overflows bypassing the red-zone padding

<li>
Use-after-free with large allocations in-between

<ol>
<li>
Memory may be reused

<li>
A stale pointer could now access a valid address that was recently allocated

</ol>
<li>
Unaligned access partially OOB:
            <em>int* a = new int[2];</em>                    --&gt; <span id="Notes on compiler sanitisers-Array with range of [0-7] bytes"></span><strong id="Array with range of [0-7] bytes">Array with range of [0-7] bytes</strong>
            <em>int* pointer = (int*)((char*)a + 6);</em>
            <em>*pointer = 1;</em>                           --&gt; <span id="Notes on compiler sanitisers-Access out of range [6-9]"></span><strong id="Access out of range [6-9]">Access out of range [6-9]</strong>

<li>
Cannot detect errors in custom allocators

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Memory Sanitiser:

<ul>
<li>
MSan, <code>-fsanitize=memory</code>

<li>
Detects uninitialised memory accesses

<li>
To get nicer stack trace in error messages use <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code>

<li>
Can track every uninitialised address to its origin with <code>-fsanitize-memory-track-origins</code>

<li>
Additional functionality (like origin tracking) comes with a higher performance cost

<li>
MSan implements a subset of the functionality found in <a href="Valgrind.html">Valgrind</a> (but its <span id="Notes on compiler sanitisers-much"></span><strong id="much">much</strong> faster)

<li>
Bit-level granularity is important for bitfields and bitarrays

<li>
Algorithm:

<ul>
<li>
Shadow each allocated bit with validity bit

<li>
When uninitialised memory is allocated, set validity to 1

<li>
Every operation that produces a value is augmented with corresponding change to the
          validity bit (including copying)

<li>
Before each read that affects program's observable behaviour, the validity bit is checked

</ul>
<li>
False Positives:

<ul>
<li>
Interaction with uninstrumented code

<li>
Initialisations in instrumented code are not intercepted

<li>
MSan allows marking objects as "safe"

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Undefined Behaviour Sanitiser:

<ul>
<li>
UBSan, <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code>

<li>
Detects division by 0, overshifts, signed integer overflow, indirect call of a function
      through a function pointer of the wrong type

<li>
Saturated add, abs (what happens close to INT_MAX and INT_MIN?)

<li>
Anything at all can happen

<li>
UB in C:

<ul>
<li>
Signed integer overflow

<li>
Reading from uninitialised variable

<li>
Pointing past the last element of an array

<li>
Aliasing between pointers of different types

<li>
Calling <code>memcpy</code> with overlapping buffers

</ul>
<li>
UB concept:

<ul>
<li>
The programming language has rules

<li>
The compiler assumes that the rules were followed, when optimising the code

<li>
If the rules are broken, the optimisations can cause some unexpected behaviour

</ul>
<li>
Saturated add:

<ul>
<li>
x + y is treated mathematically by the compiler

<li>
The optimiser then removes the final condition guard in the saturated add

</ul>
<li>
Abs:

<ul>
<li>
Abs(x) is undefined for -2<sup><small>31</small></sup> and otherwise the int is non-negative

<li>
So, a guard of (abs(x) &lt; 0) is optimised away

</ul>
<li>
Security critical example:
        <em>struct x *str = object-&gt;str;</em>
        <em>if (!object) {</em>
            <em>return error;</em>
        <em>}</em>

<li>
Why do languages allow undefined behaviour:

<ul>
<li>
Catering for diverse hardware:

<ol>
<li>
x86 signed addition wraps on overflow

<li>
MIPS signed addition traps on overflow

</ol>
<li>
To allow powerful optimisations:

<ol>
<li>
Extending int to long on a 64-bit machine when using int as an address (in a loop)

</ol>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
