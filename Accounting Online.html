        non-controlling entities

</ul>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<em>Double-entry bookkeeping</em>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Assets = liabilities + equity
   Resources = Claims on resource by Outsiders + owners

<li>
Equity = Capital + Retained Earnings
   Retained Earnings = Prior Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends
   Net Income = Revenues - Expenses

<li>
Assets = Liabilities + capital + Prior Retained Earnings + Revenues - Expenses - Dividends

<li>
Every transaction must have at least one debit and one credit. They must be equal.

</ul>

<p>
Steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Recording transactions:

<ul>
<li>
Journal entry format
        Debit (Always first)
            Credit (Always second, indented)

<li>
T-account is simply a poorly formatted table that has debit on the left and credit on the right

</ul>
<li>
Balancing off:

<ul>
<li>
Sum up T-accounts and subtract the smaller side from the bigger.

<li>
Post the balance at the bottom side of the highest amount

</ul>
<li>
Prepare the trial balance:

<ul>
<li>
All T accounts with the debits and credits

<li>
Check if the transactions were recorded correctly

<li>
BALANCE

</ul>
<li>
Adjusting entries:                         (Recognise expenses incurred)

<ul>
<li>
Inventory (after inventory counts):

<ul>
<li>
Items on hand

<li>
Debit cost of goods sold if the inventory is lacking something

</ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
From loans, etc

</ul>
<li>

</ul>

<div id="Three fundamental rules of bookkeeping"><h1 id="Three fundamental rules of bookkeeping" class="header"><a href="#Three fundamental rules of bookkeeping" class="justcenter">Three fundamental rules of bookkeeping</a></h1></div>

<ol>
<li>
Assets always equal the liabilities + equity
