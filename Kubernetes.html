<li>
Nodes - Machines that host containers in the k8s cluster (alt <code>minions</code>)

<li>
Masters - Machines that run coordinating software that schedules containers on Nodes

<li>
Cluster - A collection of masters and nodes

<li>
Pods - Collections of containers and volumes that are bundled and scheduled together because they
   share a common resource

<li>
Shared Fate - if one container in a pod dies, they all die

<li>
Labels - a key/value pair that is assigned to a k8s object to uniquely identify it

<li>
Annotations - useful information about a k8s object

<li>
Replicas - multiple copies of a pod

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
The Facts:

<ul>
<li>
Containers are lightweight -&gt; flexible and fast

<li>
Designed to be short-lived and fragile

<li>
VMs are like passenger jets - super resilient and have the swing of the entire OS behind them

<li>
Containers are like the Lunar Module - light, heavily optimised and designed to work in very
      specific and orchestrated conditions

</ul>
<li>
The Problem:

<ul>
<li>
Distribution of containers across machines (to minimise the effect of a single machine
      failure)

<li>
Detection of container failure and immediate replacement

<li>
Running containers in managed clusters and heavily orchestrating them

<li>
Management of overall network and memory resources for the cluster

</ul>
<li>
Pillars:

<ol>
<li>
Isolation - a failure of one computing unit cannot take down another

<li>
Orchestration - resources should be well-balanced geographically (load distribution)

<li>
Scheduling - detection of failures and their replacement should be near instant

</ol>
<li>
Applications vs Services:

<ul>
<li>
Service:

<ul>
<li>
Designed to do a small number of things

<li>
Has no UI and in invoked solely via some kind of API

<li>
When designing, try to make the services as light and limited purpose (aids rearranging
          them later in response to the changes in the load)

</ul>
<li>
Application:

<ul>
<li>
Has a UI (even if it is a CLI)

<li>
Performs a number of different tasks

<li>
Can possibly expose an API (but doesn't have to)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Masters:

<ul>
<li>
API Server:

<ul>
<li>
Handles API calls from nearly all components of the master or the nodes

</ul>
<li>
Etcd:

<ul>
<li>
Service

<li>
Keeps and replicates the current configuration and run state of the cluster

<li>
Lightweight distributed key-value store

<li>
Originally developed in Core OS project

</ul>
<li>
Scheduler and Controller Manager:

<ul>
<li>
Schedule pods onto target nodes

<li>
Ensure that a correct number of them are running at any given point in time

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Nodes:

<ul>
<li>
Kubelet:

<ul>
<li>
Daemon that runs on each node

<li>
Responds to commands from the master to create, destroy and monitor the containers

</ul>
<li>
Proxy:

<ul>
<li>
Simple proxy

<li>
Separates the IP address of the target container from the name of the service it provides

</ul>
<li>
cAdvisor:

<ul>
<li>
Optional

<li>
Daemon that runs on a node

<li>
Collects, aggregates, processes and exports information about running containers

<li>
I.E: Resource isolation, historical usage and key network stats

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Pods:

<ul>
<li>
In Docker every container get its own IP address

<li>
In k8s a shared IP is assigned to the pod

<li>
Containers on the same pod can communicate with one another using <code>localhost</code>

<li>
<span id="Notes on basic building blocks-Scheduling happens at the pod level, no the container level"></span><strong id="Scheduling happens at the pod level, no the container level">Scheduling happens at the pod level, no the container level</strong>

</ul>
<li>
Reasons to put services in a pod but not in a single container:

<ul>
<li>
Management Transparency:

<ul>
<li>
You assume responsibility for monitoring and managing how much resource each service in
          the container uses

<li>
If one rogue process starves others it will up to you to detect and fix that

<li>
K8s can manage it for you if the services are split into multiple containers in the same
          pod

</ul>
<li>
Deployment and Maintenance:

<ul>
<li>
Individual containers can be rebuild and redeployed whenever needed

<li>
Decoupling of deployments allows for faster iteration and testing

<li>
Simplifies rollbacks

</ul>
<li>
Focus:

<ul>
<li>
If k8s is handling all the monitoring an resource management the containers can be lighter
          and only contain the business logic

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Lack of Durability:

<ul>
<li>
Pods are not durable

<li>
From time to time the master may choose to evict the pod from its host

<li>
Pod eviction - kill it and raise a new one somewhere else

<li>
Preservation of the application state is on the developer (<span id="Notes on basic building blocks-you"></span><strong id="you">you</strong>)

<li>
Use a shared data store like Redis, Memcached or Cassandra

</ul>
<li>
Volumes:

<ul>
<li>
Docker volume - a virtual FS that the container can see and use

<li>
K8s volumes are defined at the pod level, which solves the following problems:

<ul>
<li>
Durability:

<ol>
<li>
Containers die and reborn all the time

<li>
A volume tied to a container will die with it, along with any data written to it

</ol>
<li>
Communication:

<ol>
<li>
Any container at the pod has access to the volume

<li>
Easy to move temporary data across containers

</ol>
</ul>
<li>
Its important to be clear what kind of volume is in question (a container volume or a pod one)

</ul>
<li>
Volume Types:

<ul>
<li>
<code>EmptyDir</code>:

<ul>
<li>
Most commonly used

<li>
Bound to the pod and is initially always empty when first created

<li>
Exists for the life of the pod

<li>
When the pod is evicted, the volume is destroyed and all data is lost

<li>
For the life of the pod, every container on it can read and write data to the volume

<li>
<em>Ephemeral</em> volume

</ul>
<li>
NFS:

<ul>
<li>
Mounting NFS volume at the pod level

<li>
<em>Persistent</em> volume

</ul>
<li>
GCEPersistentDisk:

<ul>
<li>
Google Cloud persistent disk that can be mounted as a volume on a pod

<li>
PD is like a managed NFS service

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
K8s provides basic ways to annotate and document the infrastructure:

<ul>
<li>
Labels:

<ul>
<li>
Decorates a pod and is a part of the <code>pod.yaml</code> file

<li>
Keys are a combination of 0 or more prefixes followed by a "/"
            E.G: "application.game/tier" vs "tier"

<li>
Labels must conform to the rules of DNS entries (DNS Labels)

<li>
Prefixes are one or more DNS Labels separated by the "." character

<li>
Max size for prefix is 253 characters

<li>
Values follow the same rules but cannot be longer than 63 characters

<li>
<span id="Notes on Cluster creation-Neither keys nor values can contain spaces"></span><strong id="Neither keys nor values can contain spaces">Neither keys nor values can contain spaces</strong>

<li>
-- Is there a way to statically check your labels to avoid missed routes? --

</ul>
<li>
Label Selectors:

<ul>
<li>
Central means of rooting and orchestration

<li>
Equality-based label selectors:

<ol>
<li>
Exact match

<li>
Can be combined like so
              tier != frontend, game = super-shooter-2

</ol>
<li>
Set-based:

<ol>
<li>
"In/Not in" kind of query

<li>
Checks the label against a set of acceptable values

<li>
Can be combined like so
              environment <code>in</code> (production, test), tier <code>notin</code> (frontend, back-end), partition

</ol>
</ul>
<li>
Annotations:

<ul>
<li>
Can be queried against

<li>
Key/value pairs and have the same rules as Labels

<li>
Information stored on it is something like build date or a URL to more information

<li>
Annotations are used to store arbitrary information about a thing that you <code>might</code> want to
          query against

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Replication Controllers:

<ul>
<li>
Replicas exist to provide scale and fault-tolerance to the cluster

<li>
Replication Controller ensures that a correct number of replicas is running at all times

<li>
Therefore it is a component that focuses on availability of the services in the pods

<li>
The controller will create and destroy replicas as it needs to

<li>
Controller operates following a set of rules defined in a <em>pod template</em>

<li>
<span id="Notes on Cluster creation-Pod template:"></span><strong id="Pod template:">Pod template:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Definition of the desired state of the cluster

<li>
Specifies which images are to be used to create each pod

<li>
Specifies how many replicas should exist

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Replication scheme in k8s is loosely coupled:

<ul>
<li>
Replication controller operates (and identifies pods) using a label selector

<li>
If the controller is killed, then replicas managed by it are unaffected

<li>
Benefits of such loose coupling:

<ul>
<li>
Removing a pod for debugging is as simple as changing the label

<li>
Changing the label selector changes which replicas are controlled in real time

<li>
Controllers can be swapped and pods will be unaffected by the change

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Notes on Cluster creation-TIP: Account for possible failures in replication controllers as well!"></span><strong id="TIP: Account for possible failures in replication controllers as well!">TIP: Account for possible failures in replication controllers as well!</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Run at least two controllers to avoid having a single point of failure

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
