Intro:

<ul>
<li>
Aims to provide a simple and high performance kernel for building coordination primitives in
      the client

<li>
Provides per-client guarantee of FIFO execution and linearizability of requests

<li>
The entire idea is instead of implementing synchronisation primitives server-side, they expose
      an API and allow clients to define their own

<li>
Exposed API manipulates simple wait-free data objects organised hierarchially

<li>
ZooKeeper resembles any other filesystem (Chubby without lock, open and close methods)

<li>
Exposed API can implement consensus for any number of processes

<li>
Pipelined architecture --&gt; FIFO per clients for free

<li>
Guaranteeing FIFO enables clients to submit requests asynchronously:

<ul>
<li>
If a new leader is elected, it has to update metadata. Metadata updates are queued
          asynchronously and initialisation is of sub-second order (compared to synchronous
          initialisation)

</ul>
<li>
Zab --&gt; Leader-based atomic broadcast protocol (to order things)

<li>
<span id="Notes on ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems-Read operations are not totally ordered"></span><strong id="Read operations are not totally ordered">Read operations are not totally ordered</strong>

<li>
Client-side caching is used for things like leader id (observer pattern in cache):

<ul>
<li>
Better than Chubby, since Chubby pauses updates to invalidate all caches (that use changed
          data)

<li>
Chubby uses leases to manage slow/faulty clients, but ZooKeeper avoids the problem
          altogether by allowing clients to manage cache

</ul>
<li>
Only writes are linearizable

</ul>
<li>
The ZooKeeper service:

<ul>
<li>
Overview:

<ul>
<li>
<em>Client</em> -- user of the ZooKeeper service

<li>
<em>Server</em> -- process providing the ZooKeeper service

<li>
<em>Znode</em> -- in-memory data node in the ZooKeeper data

<li>
Referring to a znode is done with standard UNIX notation of A/B/C

</ul>
<li>
Znodes:

<ul>
<li>
Regular -- created and deleted by client explicitly

<li>
Ephemeral -- Created explicitly, deleted explicitly or when the creating session
          terminates

<li>
Znodes have a <em>sequential</em> flag set upon creation. If set it appends the value of a
          monothonically increasing counter to the znodes name

<li>
<span id="Notes on ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems-Unlike files, znodes are not designed for general data storage"></span><strong id="Unlike files, znodes are not designed for general data storage">Unlike files, znodes are not designed for general data storage</strong>

<li>
Have associated metadata, timestamps and version counters (allows tracking and
          conditional updates)

</ul>
<li>
Watches (Observer subscriptions):

<ul>
<li>
Update clients in a timely manner and avoid polling

<li>
Read operations have a watch flag. When set the server promises to notify the client when
          the information it has just returned (as part of a read) has changed

<li>
Watches are one-time triggers associated with a session (unregistered once triggered or
          the session closes)

<li>
<span id="Notes on ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems-Watches indicate that a change has happened but do not provide the change"></span><strong id="Watches indicate that a change has happened but do not provide the change">Watches indicate that a change has happened but do not provide the change</strong>

</ul>
<li>
Data Model:

<ul>
<li>
Filesystem (key/value storage with hierarchial keys) with full data reads and writes

<li>
Hierarchial namespace is useful for distinguishing applications and setting access rights

</ul>
<li>
Sessions:

<ul>
<li>
Client connection initiates the session

<li>
Sessions have a timeout

<li>
Client marked as faulty if there are no updates from it in the timeout window

<li>
Session is ended when the client closes it, or marked as faulty

<li>
Within a session the client observes a succession of state changes (execution of its
          operations)

<li>
Sessions enable clients to move transparently from one server to another (persist across
          servers)

</ul>
<li>
Client API:

<ul>
<li>
Allows creation, deletion and exists check on znodes

<li>
Get and set data stored in the znode

<li>
Get children of a znode

<li>
Waiting for all updates pending at the start of the operation to propagate to the server
          that the client is connected to (sync call).

<li>
All methods have both - synchronous and asynchronous versions available

<li>
ZooKeeper does not use handles to access znodes (every request uses the full path)

<li>
Each update method takes an "expected version number" --&gt; enable conditional updates

<li>
Expected version -1 --&gt; no version check on update

</ul>
<li>
Guarantees:

<ul>
<li>
FIFO and linearizability (a-linearizability -- client is multithreaded)

<li>
Read requests are processed locally at each replica

<li>
Only updates are a-linearizable

<li>
Example: Leader election - delete the <em>ready</em> znode, update config, create <em>ready</em>

<li>
Liveness - if a majority of servers are active and communicating the service is available

<li>
Durability - if the service responds successfully to an update - the update persists

</ul>
<li>
Examples of primitives: (implementing more powerful primitives)

<ul>
<li>
All primitives are implemented in the client

<li>
Configuration Management:

<ol>
<li>
Configuration is stored in znode A

<li>
Processes start up with a full path to A

<li>
Starting processes read A and set the watch flag to be true

<li>
If A ever changes, they receive the notification and update their config accordingly

<li>
After they update, they set the watch flag again

</ol>
<li>
Rendezvous:

<ol>
<li>
Client creates a rendezvous node A

<li>
Client passes the full path to A as a parameter to its peer

<li>
When the peer starts, it fills A with all addresses and ports it is using

<li>
When workers start they watch-read A

</ol>
<li>
Group Membership:

<ol>
<li>
Use the fact that ephemeral nodes allow us to see the state of the session that
              created them

<li>
Create znode A to represent the group

<li>
When a process in A starts, it creates an ephemeral child of A (A/Ai)

<li>
To ensure that names are unique (if not already), processes can use the sequential
              flag

</ol>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
