<ol>
<li>
Monolith is hard to work on:

<ul>
<li>
Iterations are slow

<li>
Releases are hard (code changes from under you)

</ul>
<li>
Different components of the system should have different performance targets:

<ul>
<li>
Written in different languages

<li>
Run on different machines

</ul>
<li>
Migration difficulty:

<ul>
<li>
Maintain public API contracts

</ul>
<li>
Microservices shift complexity into the network:

<ul>
<li>
Who calls who?

<li>
Many moving parts to fulfill simple requests

</ul>
<li>
Monzo:

<ul>
<li>
1500 services

</ul>
<li>
Should we start with Microservices? (it depends)

<ul>
<li>
Cost of replacing one part is low

<li>
Monolith is more flexible in restructuring

</ul>
<li>
Splitting:

<ul>
<li>
Bounded Contexts:

<ul>
<li>
From Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans

<li>
Idea of a context (a model of what we are trying to do)

<li>
Split the services based on what they do

<li>
Product teams (think THG)

</ul>
<li>
Conway's Law:

<ul>
<li>
Systems reflect the communication process between teams

</ul>
<li>
Airbnb:

<ul>
<li>
They kept a lot of their code themselves

<li>
Intercepted a call and redirected what it did

<li>
Routing events produced by the databases

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Monorepo vs Multi-repo:

<ul>
<li>
Every developer has all the code checked out

<li>
A lot more management overhead

<li>
Do not recompile all of the code

<li>
As always, it depends...

</ul>
<li>
Strangler Pattern:

<ul>
<li>
Write stuff "around" the existing system

<li>
Intercept requests and reroute them to new systems

<li>
Nginx proxy could do that for you

</ul>
<li>
When to redactor a system and when to rewrite it?

</ol>

<div id="Individual Coursework-Cloud Native Applications"><h2 id="Cloud Native Applications" class="header"><a href="#Individual Coursework-Cloud Native Applications" class="justcenter">Cloud Native Applications</a></h2></div>

<ol>
<li>
A system where the cloud is the primary deployment system

<li>
Reasons:

<ul>
<li>
Lots of services available

<li>
Scaling is easy

<li>
Dynamic scaling is easy (load in the morning, nothing for the rest of the day)

<li>
CapEX VS OpEX --&gt; Less capital involvement

</ul>
<li>
Spectrum:

<ul>
<li>
IAAS  -- infrastructure as a service

<li>
CoAAS -- Container as a service

<li>
PAAS  -- platform as a service

<li>
FAAS  -- function as a service

</ul>
<li>
Containers:
    -

</ol>

<li>
Sam Newman:

<ul>
<li>
Building Microservices

<li>
Monolith to Microservices

</ul>
<li>
Intro:

<ol>
<li>
Microservices in modern world

<li>
What problem are they solving

<li>
Why they may be a worse choice for a company

<li>
Microservices should reflect internal company structure

</ol>
</ol>
